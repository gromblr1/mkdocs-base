Tutanota does not allow past searches.  
Tutanota does not have an image viewer.  

Disroot.org has an excellent search.  
Disroot.org is a lil bit slow (but tolerable).  
Disroot.org allegedly has up to 4GB instead of 1GB.  

# ALTERNATIVE to Google     
*Note: Definitely would recommmend using DDG by default and use DDG's [**!bang**](https://duckduckgo.com/bang)([full list](https://duckduckgo.com/bang_lite.html)) feature.*

# ALTERNATIVE TO BARNES & NOBLE
[Better WOrld Books](https://www.betterworldbooks.com/): Better World Books is a socially conscious used book store that's allied with the Internet Archive. It's got great selection, but the item quality can vary (lots of ex-library books with covers, stickers, or damage).  
[Book Outlet](https://bookoutlet.com/): Book Outlet sells remaindered books for cheap. Selection is more limited than BWB (and a lot of their stock isn't great), but the books are new (with only a remainder mark).  
[InStockTrades](https://instocktrades.com): InStockTrades is good for comics and graphic novels, with prices that often beat Amazon.
