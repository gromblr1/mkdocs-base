# TRINITY OF TERROR

> If there is a tree in the forest and it breaks, does it make a sound ?  
    If humanity was wiped away forever, would there be sadness ? 
    Anger ? Happiness ? <b>TERROR</b> ?

I was apart of a triad of gods called the Trinity of Terror.  
  The other 2 gods were slayed by..... eldritch abominations.  
    I was exiled to a remote planet in the middle of a void; the planet of Elba, where I had narrowly escaped.   

One of those eldritch monsters almost ripped my face off as I escaped my fate.  
The monstrously decrepit hand hugging my face is a testament to that.
